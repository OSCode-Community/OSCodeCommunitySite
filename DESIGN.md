# Logo Designâœ¨

We have worked hard to create a theme and identity of our brand that will not only resonate with our work and community but will stand out and make it unique. This logo that we created is based on our ideals as a community. This is a simple minimalistic rendition that is versatile and scalable to potray who we are.

If you are interested in designing logo, you can give it a try!!ðŸ¤©
